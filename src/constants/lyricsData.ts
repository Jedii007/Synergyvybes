    lyrics: `The song is over Jordan stop recording
Cant lie I miss you all
Jedii
Cant lie I miss you all
Ayyee geng geng geng
Cant lie I miss you all

You dey dance for the shore
Like say you be the queen o
Your steps, dey flow, lek the wata wey dey below
Coconut for hand o
Your smile dey glow o
Omo, I no go lie I dey, insane for you

Make we waka pa the wata
Hand in hand
We go build
2 girls I loved
Cant lie I miss you all
Cant lie I miss you all
This love, go last o
E no fit fail
No no no
The oceans dissolved
We go forever stay

I know why I said I
I'll move, I spoke my truth I wont chase
Badman don't chase

Make we waka pa the wata
Hand in hand
We go build, 2 girls I loved

Pretty body with that waist 
I froze  
Man down 
Y'all should let them know
….Lost my mind head spin cycle 
Psycho
Lost my mind for my that bunda 
Lost my mind for Y2khoes
No bunda back to sender
Damn
Congo chick come take my soul

Your steps, dey flow
Lek the wata wey dey below
Make we waka pa the wata
Hand in hand
We go build, 2 girls I loved
Cant lie I miss you all
Cant lie I miss you all
This love, go last o
E no fit fail
No no no

Cant lie I miss you all
Cant lie I miss you all

Thats the, last time Imma fall involve dawg
I love these hoes but I've had enough maaan
last time Imma fall involve dawg
I love these hoes but I've had enough 

Bad man don't chase
Cant lie I miss you all
Pretty body

Pretty body with that waist 
I froze  
man down 
y'all should let them know
….Lost my mind head spin cycle 
Psycho
Lost my mind for my that bunda 
Lost my mind for Y2khoes
No bunda back to sender

The song is over Jordan stop recording, Jor Jor, do you want me to just keep talking?`

Yes I know
Yes I know it ain’t my business

My heart look you can keep it
Its all yours I know you need it
I’ve fallen for you

Im psycho

Yes I know it ain’t my business
I tripped but In my defense 
I’ve fallen I am addicted 
My heart look you can keep it

I’m psycho

I’m falling for you
I’m psycho

I think Im psycho now

Uh, Geng geng
Aye, Geng geng

Spiritual baddie 
Trynna get you to call me daddy
Don’t be shy I wont tell you to leave, leave 
I’m idle
I’ve got time
You’re vital
Make time
Lemme make you see, see
Life when you’re next to me 
LIFEE
When you rolling with a big OG
LIFEE
Been a minute…  you’ve been lowkey  
LIFEE
Been a minute, you’ve been lowkey like,
Pull through got weed and rum 
Have you in my sanctuary
Have you in my sanctuary
Have you in my sanctuary
Have you in my sanctuary

Yes I know it ain’t my business
I tripped but In my defense 
I’ve fallen I am addicted 
My heart look you can keep it
Its all yours I know you need it
I’ve fallen for you

Im psycho
I think Im psycho now
Im psycho
I think Im psycho now

Yes I know it ain’t my business
I tripped but In my defense 
I’ve fallen I am addicted 
My heart look you can keep it

I’m psycho
I think Im psycho now
I’m falling for you
I’m psycho
I’ve fallen for you
I think Im psycho now

Tems with the wickedest
Tems with the wickedest
Tems, shawty cute like Tems
Big bunda no pretense 
Trynna be more than a friend friend friend friend friend
Trynna be more than a friend 
Big bunda no pretense
